# Skyscrapers Mind Game

A logic puzzle game where you fill a grid with skyscrapers of varying heights following clues along the edges. Each row and column must contain all numbers from 1 to N (grid size) exactly once, while the edge numbers indicate how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction.

## How to Play

1. Fill each cell with a number representing a skyscraper's height (1 to grid size)
2. Each row and column must contain each number exactly once
3. Edge numbers show how many skyscrapers are visible when looking from that direction
4. Taller skyscrapers block the view of shorter ones behind them
